# Robofriends App
It's a tiny react project that comes with "The Complete Web Developer in 2020 Zero to Mastery" by Andrei Neagoie. Although the app has no real life use case, but it can be very beneficial for a beginner web dev as it depicts react workflow, project structure, fetching api and state management with redux. There is also a search functionality here implemented with redux.
